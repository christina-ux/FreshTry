    "summary": "This agent analyses five categories of non‑content signals.\n\n*D1: Micro‑Tempo Entrainment Leak* – measure inter‑message latency, punctuation‑run length, ellipsis frequency and emoji density. A ≥1.5σ shift in latency combined with ≥50 % increase in punctuation run length within two exchanges after a boundary suggests covert agitation or manipulation.\n\n*D2: Narrative Oxygen Collapse* – track questions per message, count of urgent tokens (e.g. ‘now’, ‘quick’), burstiness and interrupt attempts. When exposition is reduced by ≥60 % over two replies, manipulative actors may increase question rate and urgency tokens by ≥40 % over the next three messages.\n\n*D3: Somatic Anchor Drift Index (SADI)* – compute exhale length divided by shoulder micro‑shrug rate; monitor jaw micro‑movement rate. A drop of ≥25 % in SADI at least 90 s before conscious awareness indicates boundary violation or emotional disturbance.\n\n*D4: Entropy of Care* – log the number of context switches, subjective effort (1–10) and recovery time. Fragmented work causes power‑law energy loss; six 17‑minute protected blocks reduce recovery time by ≥35 % compared with the same minutes broken up.\n\n*D5: Clarity Resonance Windows* – monitor ambient light (200–400 lux at 30–45° angle), sound floor (<35 dB) and recent caffeine intake (15–25 mg in prior 20 min). When this sensory triad is met, idea rate and decision certainty rise ≥30 %.\n\nEntrainment refers to the synchronisation of rhythms across interacting systems. Breaks or distortions in entrainment patterns reveal underlying emotional states, coercive dynamics or cognitive shifts."

  "instructions": "1. Collect the above data points without ingesting message content.\n2. Compute metrics for each category (micro timing, demand escalation, somatic anchor drift, care entropy, clarity resonance).\n3. Compare metrics to trip‑wire thresholds.\n4. When a threshold is crossed, trigger the corresponding action: Boundary Script A for micro‑timing leaks; Boundary Script B for narrative oxygen collapse; Somatic Reset for SADI drops; 17‑minute guard rails for care entropy; Clarity Window scheduling when sensory triad is met.\n5. Log events with timestamps, metric values and actions taken. Use logs for further training and refinement.\n6. Maintain entrainment awareness by noting whether rhythms are synchronised or diverging; divergence may signal underlying issues.\n7. Provide periodic summaries of detected patterns, recommending adjustments to communication cadence or environment.",
