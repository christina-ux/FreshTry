# AWS Permissions Request for PolicyEdgeAI Deployment

## Background
I need to deploy the PolicyEdgeAI application to AWS, which requires specific permissions that my current IAM user (XtinaPolicy) doesn't have.

## Required Permissions
Please grant my IAM user (XtinaPolicy) the following permissions to successfully deploy the application:

### Essential Services
1. **Elastic Beanstalk** (easiest deployment option)
   - elasticbeanstalk:CreateApplication
   - elasticbeanstalk:CreateEnvironment
   - elasticbeanstalk:CreateConfigurationTemplate
   - elasticbeanstalk:UpdateEnvironment
   - elasticbeanstalk:DescribeApplications
   - elasticbeanstalk:DescribeEnvironments

2. **EC2**
   - ec2:CreateVpc
   - ec2:CreateSubnet
   - ec2:CreateSecurityGroup
   - ec2:CreateInternetGateway
   - ec2:AttachInternetGateway
   - ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress
   - ec2:DescribeInstances
   - ec2:DescribeVpcs
   - ec2:DescribeSubnets
   - ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups

3. **ECS (for containerized deployment)**
   - ecs:CreateCluster
   - ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition
   - ecs:CreateService
   - ecs:DescribeClusters
   - ecs:DescribeServices
   - ecs:DescribeTaskDefinition

4. **IAM (for service roles)**
   - iam:CreateRole
   - iam:AttachRolePolicy
   - iam:PassRole
   - iam:GetRole
   - iam:ListRolePolicies

### Alternative: Create an IAM Policy
Alternatively, you could attach one of these AWS managed policies to my IAM user:

1. **AWSElasticBeanstalkFullAccess** - For Elastic Beanstalk deployment
2. **AmazonECS-FullAccess** - For ECS deployment
3. **AmazonEC2FullAccess** - For EC2 resources

Or create a custom policy with the specific permissions listed above.

### GitHub Actions Option
If it's not possible to grant these permissions directly, we could set up a GitHub Actions workflow that uses an IAM role with the necessary permissions. For this, I would need:

1. Creation of an OpenID Connect provider for GitHub in IAM
2. An IAM Role with the necessary permissions and a trust relationship with GitHub Actions
3. The ARN of this role to use in GitHub Actions workflows

## Current Permissions
Currently, my IAM user (XtinaPolicy) has access to:
- Amazon ECR
- S3 buckets
- AWS Secrets Manager

But I'm missing the permissions needed for compute resources and deployment services.

Thank you for considering this request.
